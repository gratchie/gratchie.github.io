I work at a large visual effects studio in Los Angeles. I'm in charge of architecting, deployment and maintenance of hundreds of systems infrastructure needed to render cinematic visual effects, at scale.


My prefered weapon of choice:

* Centos / RHEL
* Puppet / Ansible
* Docker
* Rsyslog / Logstash / Kibana
* Graphite / influxdb / grafana
* Sensu / Nagios
* Ganglia
* Vim / Atom
