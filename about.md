I'm a Sr. Systems Engineer at a large visual effects studios in Hollywood. I'm in charge of architecting, deployment and maintenance of hundreds of systems infrastructure needed to render cinematic visual effects, at scale.


My prefered weapon of choice:

* Centos / RHEL
* Puppet
* Docker
* Rsyslog / Logstash / Kibana
* Graphite / influxdb / grafana
* Sensu / Nagios
* Ganglia
* Vim / Atom
